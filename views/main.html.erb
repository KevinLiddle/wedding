        <p>I met Derek during our awkward high school years, while we skateboarded and listened to terrible music. Derek even played some of that terrible music himself as the lead singer of a pop-punk band (yeah yeaaaaah yeah). We mostly made it out of those awkward years and into adulthood. He asked me to be the Godfather of his awesome son, Parker, and I asked him to be the Best Man in my wedding.</p>

      <div class="column two-thirds">
        <p>Dave is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Liddle Boy and so he has all of the baggage of the middle child. That may explain why he hasn&rsquo;t actually agreed to be in the wedding yet, but I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and call his bluff. You can expect to see him there, possibly with his adorable bulldogs, Meechie (pictured on the left) and Bruno.</p>

      <div class="column two-thirds">
        <p>Steve is the oldest Liddle Boy, so he both looked out for his brothers and annoyed us thoroughly. He is a science teacher at Grant High School in Lakemoor, IL, which allows him to get some pretty cool pictures like the one you see here (I think he&rsquo;s lighting off a firecracker in his hand). He&rsquo;s not being as difficult as Dave about being in my wedding, so he&rsquo;s winning for now.</p>

        <p>Brian claims that we met when I told him that I was color blind on the bus in junior high (I&rsquo;m not). I think he&rsquo;s a liar and we really met in high school. We had plenty of memorable times, but when I try to think of a single one, all I get is a blur of hacky sack, marco polo, and beer. That sounds like a pretty good life.</p>
